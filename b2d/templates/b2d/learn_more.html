                <p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Investing
                    in startups and
                    early-stage businesses carries significant risks. You
                    should carefully evaluate the following risks before
                    investing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Capital</strong> The business may fail,
                        leading to a complete or partial loss of your
                        investment.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Illiquidity</strong> Investments in startups
                        are generally illiquid, meaning you might not be able
                        to withdraw or sell your shares quickly or at all.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dilution</strong> Future funding rounds may
                        dilute your equity, which can reduce the percentage of
                        the business you own.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Business Risk</strong> Each business faces
                        unique risks related to its operations, market
                        competition, and external factors.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No Guarantee of Returns</strong> There is no
                        guarantee of receiving dividends or that the business
                        will succeed in generating returns.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Long-Term Horizon</strong> Investments in
                        startups are typically long-term and may take years to
                        mature before you see any returns, if any.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory and Legal Risks</strong> Changes in
                        regulations or laws could negatively affect the
                        business or its ability to succeed.
